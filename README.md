# IRCR - The Internet Relay Chat Ripoff

Welcome to IRCR, a not-so-intelligent and completely pointless clone of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) system. While it may look like IRC on the surface, we assure you it has absolutely nothing to do with actual IRC functionality. So, please don't waste your time using this piece of crap.

## Features (or lack thereof)

- **Architectural Marvel**: IRCR's codebase is a magnificent masterpiece of spaghetti code and questionable design choices. It's like a Picasso painting, but in the form of poorly written software.

- **Minimalistic Interface**: Embracing the retro vibe, IRCR sports a minimalist interface that will transport you straight back to the '90s. We spared no expense on the pixelated graphics and nostalgic color scheme.

- **Nonexistent Security**: Worried about privacy? Don't be! IRCR has no security features whatsoever. Your messages will be transmitted through the vastness of the internet for anyone to intercept and laugh at. Who needs encryption, right?

## Usage

To get started with this utterly pointless creation, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine. But seriously, why would you even want to do that?

2. **Configuration**: Open up the code and modify all the variables, settings, and constants you can find. Make sure to introduce as many bugs as possible along the way.

3. **Launch**: Run the application and prepare to be underwhelmed by the sheer lack of functionality. Don't forget to facepalm repeatedly as you navigate through its useless features.

4. **Laugh**: Have a good laugh at the stupidity of this project. Share the experience with your friends and see if they can comprehend the true meaning of "pointless."

## Contributing

We don't encourage contributions because that would imply there's something worth improving in this hot mess of a project. But if you're feeling particularly masochistic, feel free to create a pull request with your mind-blowing "improvements." We'll probably reject it, though.

## License

IRCR is proudly presented under the **WTFPL** (DO WHAT THE F\*\*K YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE). In other words, do whatever the f**k you want with this dumpster fire of a codebase. We take no responsibility for any damage caused by this project (including mental anguish, loss of hair, or urges to become a goat farmer).

## Acknowledgments

We'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to anyone who accidentally stumbled upon this repository. We apologize for wasting your precious time and sanity.

Special thanks to the entire team (consisting of one brain dead programmer) for their unwavering dedication to creating something so utterly useless. Your commitment to pointlessness is commendable.
